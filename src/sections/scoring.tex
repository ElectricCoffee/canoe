\section{Scoring}
Each cube scores its face value, except for the 1---called a \textit{Blunt}---which scores no points\footnote{Why the blunt was not just a 0, I will never know...}.
Each player totals up the point values of all their cubes. Whoever scored the most wins.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{r|c|c|c|c|c|c}
        \textbf{Face Value} & 1 & 8 & 16 & 24 & 32 & 40\\\hline
        \textbf{Point Value} & 0 & 8 & 16 & 24 & 32 & 40
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Drawn Game}
The game ends in a draw if either both players have the same final score, or if both players refuse to make a move during the game.
