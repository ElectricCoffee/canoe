\section{Setup}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Players decide amongst themselves which colour they wish to play.
    \item Each player takes six of the seven available cubes and mixes them up, rolling them onto the play area.
    \item These cubes are then placed in the bank behind the player's starting line in whichever configuration they see fit.
    \item Both players now roll the final cube and place it in the middle of the row furthest away from their cubes.
\end{enumerate}
The player who rolled the highest number on this cube starts the game.
