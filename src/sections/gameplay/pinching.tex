\subsection{Pinching}
Pinching is when a player moves their cube onto an opponent's cube of equal value.

That is to say, suppose Black has a 32 cube, and Ivory has a 24 cube four spaces away. 
Should Ivory roll a four, they'd be able to pinch Black's cube by first increasing the value up from 24 to 32, then moving the cube four spaces onto Black's cube.

Pinched cubes are removed from play and placed in the pincher's pocket.

\paragraph{Note} It is not allowed on the first move by the first player.

\paragraph{Note} You cannot pinch with a cube that just crossed the starting line.
