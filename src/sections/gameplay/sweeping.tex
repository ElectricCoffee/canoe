\subsection{Sweeping}
Sweeping happens at the end of the game when either bearing off the seventh and final cube or pinching the opponent's seventh cube---this is officially known as ``Sudden Death''.
Successfully doing either lets the active player sweep the board.

Sweeping the board gives the active player the top cube in every set left on the board, as well as every cube not part of a set.
The sweeped cubes are added to the active player's Pocket as points.
