\section{Gameplay}
Players roll two dice of their chosen colour at the start of their turn.
The values of these dice are not combined, but instead used to move two cubes around the board individually.

Players can score points by \textit{Pinching} (Section~\ref{sec:pinching}) the opponent's cubes by moving their own cube of equal numeric value on top of them, or by \textit{Bearing Off} (Section~\ref{sec:bearing-off}) their own cubes, by first forming a stack of like-valued cubes, and then moving them off the board.

\note The dice values cannot be combined unless the cubes are moved as a stack (see Section~\ref{sec:bearing-off})

\note At any point in the game, a player may choose to simply pass, doing nothing this turn\footnote{Passing is mentioned in the FAQ}.
The passing player \textbf{must} pass on both dice, and cannot simply move with one and pass on the other.

\note A player is permitted to simply move their cubes within the bank, though once they leave the bank, they cannot move back in unless as part of a set (see Section~\ref{sec:bearing-off}).
