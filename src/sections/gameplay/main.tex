\section{Gameplay}
Players roll two dice of their chosen colour at the start of their turn.
The values of these dice are not combined, but instead used to move two cubes around the board individually. 

\note The dice values cannot be combined unless you're moving a stack (see Section~\ref{sec:bearing-off})
