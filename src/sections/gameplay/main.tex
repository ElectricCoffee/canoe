\section{Gameplay}
Players roll two dice of their chosen colour at the start of their turn.
The values of these dice are not combined, but instead used to move two cubes around the board individually.

Players can score points by \textit{Pinching} (Section~\ref{sec:pinching}) the opponent's cubes by moving their own cube of equal numeric value on top of them, or by \textit{Bearing Off} (Section~\ref{sec:bearing-off}) their own cubes, by first forming a stack of like-valued cubes, and then moving them off the board.

\note The dice values cannot be combined unless the cubes are moved as a stack (see Section~\ref{sec:bearing-off})
